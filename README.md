_Python 3 scripts for AmateurDSN_

This repository holds a bunch of Python 3 scripts aiming to ease your life if you are playing the AmateurDSN game. It currently contains:

* **[driftplot.py](driftplot.py)**: Takes drift logs generated by the Drift Tool of [SigDigger's](https://github.com/BatchDrake/SigDigger) [AmateurDSN plugin](https://github.com/BatchDrake/AmateurDSN), and plots Doppler shift and drift curves.
* **[plotobject.py](plotobject.py)**: Queries transit curves of a spacecraft to [NASA's Horizons system](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/app.html#/), and plots it.
